# Fraud-Analytics-and-Malware-Detection
Fraud Analytics Project where once a pdf file is uploaded it's text and metadata are extracted and classification of hyperlinks in benign, defacement and phishing using LSTM model second part is classifying pdf is fraudulent or edited based on it's metadata using Random Forest Classfier.

The provided project aims to develop a PDF file classifier that distinguishes between benign and potentially phishing PDFs based on various metadata and content characteristics. This classifier employs a Random Forest machine learning model for prediction. Below is a brief description of the project's key components and functionalities:

Dataset Overview:

The project utilizes the "Evasive-PDFMal2022" dataset, which comprises 9,906 PDF records. Among these, 5,438 are labeled as malicious, while 4,468 are labeled as benign. This dataset is designed to challenge common machine learning algorithms as it contains records that attempt to evade detection through significant feature variations.
Data Exploration and Visualization:

The project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset's characteristics, including features such as file size, metadata size, number of pages, embedded files, images, text content, JavaScript code, and class labels (benign or malicious).
Histograms and count plots are generated to visualize the distribution and frequencies of numeric and categorical attributes.
A correlation matrix heatmap is created to identify relationships between numeric features.
Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing includes label encoding for the 'text' feature, which likely represents the text content extracted from the PDFs.
Dataset Splitting:

The dataset is split into features (X) and labels (y).
A train-test split is performed, allocating 25% of the data for testing while using the remaining 75% for model training.
Random Forest Classifier:

A Random Forest classifier is chosen as the machine learning model for this project.
The classifier is configured with 100 decision trees and a random state for reproducibility.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The Random Forest classifier is trained on the training data, allowing it to learn patterns and associations between features and class labels.
Predictions are made on the test data, and the classifier's accuracy is evaluated.
Model Saving and Loading:

The trained Random Forest classifier is saved to a file for future use.
This enables the model to be loaded and applied to new PDF files for phishing classification without retraining.
PDF Analysis:

The project demonstrates how to analyze a PDF file by extracting various attributes and characteristics.
Key PDF features analyzed include file size, metadata size, image count, text presence, JavaScript code presence, number of embedded files, and more.
Phishing Prediction:

Using the trained Random Forest classifier, the project predicts whether the analyzed PDF is benign or potentially malicious (phishing).
Predictions are made based on the extracted PDF attributes and characteristics.
Metadata Inspection:

The project inspects PDF metadata, including creation and modification dates.
It checks whether a PDF has been edited based on the comparison of creation and modification dates.
