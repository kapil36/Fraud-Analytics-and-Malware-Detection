# Fraud-Analytics-and-Malware-Detection
Fraud Analytics Project where once a pdf file is uploaded it's text and metadata are extracted and classification of hyperlinks in benign, defacement and phishing using LSTM model second part is classifying pdf is fraudulent or edited based on it's metadata using Random Forest Classfier.

The provided project aims to develop a PDF file classifier that distinguishes between benign and potentially phishing PDFs based on various metadata and content characteristics. This classifier employs a Random Forest machine learning model for prediction. Below is a brief description of the project's key components and functionalities:

Dataset Overview:

The project utilizes the "Evasive-PDFMal2022" dataset, which comprises 9,906 PDF records. Among these, 5,438 are labeled as malicious, while 4,468 are labeled as benign. This dataset is designed to challenge common machine learning algorithms as it contains records that attempt to evade detection through significant feature variations.
Data Exploration and Visualization:

The project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset's characteristics, including features such as file size, metadata size, number of pages, embedded files, images, text content, JavaScript code, and class labels (benign or malicious).
Histograms and count plots are generated to visualize the distribution and frequencies of numeric and categorical attributes.
A correlation matrix heatmap is created to identify relationships between numeric features.
Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing includes label encoding for the 'text' feature, which likely represents the text content extracted from the PDFs.
Dataset Splitting:

The dataset is split into features (X) and labels (y).
A train-test split is performed, allocating 25% of the data for testing while using the remaining 75% for model training.
Random Forest Classifier:

A Random Forest classifier is chosen as the machine learning model for this project.
The classifier is configured with 100 decision trees and a random state for reproducibility.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The Random Forest classifier is trained on the training data, allowing it to learn patterns and associations between features and class labels.
Predictions are made on the test data, and the classifier's accuracy is evaluated.
Model Saving and Loading:

The trained Random Forest classifier is saved to a file for future use.
This enables the model to be loaded and applied to new PDF files for phishing classification without retraining.
PDF Analysis:

The project demonstrates how to analyze a PDF file by extracting various attributes and characteristics.
Key PDF features analyzed include file size, metadata size, image count, text presence, JavaScript code presence, number of embedded files, and more.
Phishing Prediction:

Using the trained Random Forest classifier, the project predicts whether the analyzed PDF is benign or potentially malicious (phishing).
Predictions are made based on the extracted PDF attributes and characteristics.
Metadata Inspection:

The project inspects PDF metadata, including creation and modification dates.
It checks whether a PDF has been edited based on the comparison of creation and modification dates.

The project described in the provided code is a Malware Link Classifier for PDF files. Its primary purpose is to analyze the content of PDF files and identify hyperlinks within them as either benign (safe), related to defacement (website vandalism), or associated with phishing (fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information). The project involves several key components and utilizes machine learning techniques to accomplish this classification task:

Data Preprocessing:

The project begins by loading a modified dataset ('malurl_final.csv') containing URLs and their corresponding classes (benign, defacement, or phishing). Rows with missing values in the 'class' column are removed.
Tokenization and Padding:

The URLs are tokenized and converted into sequences of integers using the Tokenizer from the TensorFlow library.
The sequences are then padded to ensure uniform length, making them suitable for input into a neural network.
Custom Dataset and DataLoader:

A custom dataset ('URLDataset') is created to organize the tokenized URLs along with their corresponding class labels.
A custom collate function ('collate_fn') is defined to handle variable-length sequences during batch processing.
Data loaders ('train_loader' and 'test_loader') are created to efficiently feed data to the model during training and evaluation.
LSTM-based Classifier Model:

The project defines a neural network model ('URLClassifier') with an Embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a fully connected (linear) layer.
The model is designed to process tokenized URL sequences and make predictions regarding their classes.
Model Training:

The classifier model is trained on the training dataset using a cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
Training occurs over multiple epochs, with mini-batches of data being processed in each iteration.
Model Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.
Evaluation metrics such as test loss and test accuracy are calculated and printed for each epoch.
Flask Web Application:

The project incorporates a web application using Flask. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading PDF files for analysis.
The 'extract_text_from_pdf' function extracts text content from uploaded PDFs, while 'extract_links_from_text' identifies hyperlinks in the extracted text.
Predictions and Results:

For each extracted hyperlink, the project preprocesses the link, passes it through the trained model, and predicts its class (benign, defacement, or phishing).
The results are displayed in an HTML page, showing the predicted class for each link and the count of links in each class.
Deployment:

The web application is deployed using the Flask-Ngrok extension, making it accessible over the internet.
